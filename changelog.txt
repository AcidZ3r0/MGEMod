1.0.4 - April 10th, 2012
	Fixes:
		- Slightly tweaked !first command logic so that if you are already in an arena waiting for a game, it won't put you into another empty arena.
		- Weapon names are now properly sanitized in the stats system.
		- Reverted Endif to infinite ammo by default. (Can't be assed to make infinite reserve ammo on a per-arena basis.)
		- Updated Russian and German translations.
		- WebUI now properly supports remote databases. Thanks to jameless for the fix.

	Tweaks:
		- BBall now has a default capture limit of 10, and a default respawn time of 2 seconds. As always, this can be changed to your liking in mgemod_spawns.cfg.
		
1.0.3 - March 19th, 2012
	Additions:
	+ Added handicap system.
		- Used to lower your maximum health. Cannot be used to raise health.
		- Type "!handicap <number>" to set your handicap. Example: '!handicap 100' will set your max health to 100.
		- Type "!handicap off" to disable.

	Fixes:
	- Fixed a regression that caused the !mgehelp chat command to not work.
	- Fixed a regression that caused mgemod_dbconfig, mgemod_bball_particle_red, and mgemod_bball_particle_blue to not detect changes.
	- Fixed improper player disconnect handling that caused kicked and lagged out players to not get processed correctly.
		- As a result, they will no longer interfere with queues or cause errorlog spam.
	
	Thanks:
	- Thrawn2 for pointing me in the right direction regarding kicked clients.
	- Bombz for helping me test and pointing out the convar regressions.

1.0.2 - March 10th, 2012
	Fixes:
	- Fixed an issue that caused gameplay to get buggy after mapchanges.

1.0.1 - March 9th, 2012
	Fixes:
	- Fixed a bug in the stats system that prevented the plugin from loading (oops).

1.0.0 - March 7th, 2012
	Optimization:
	- Removed many unnecessary checks, especially for functions run on every frame.
	- Removed redundant and deprecated functions that dealt with particles.

	Fixes:
	- All 9 classes can now be defined in the spawns config, as originally intended (Thank's to useoftoaster for the basis to the Heavy workaround).
	- Changed the way players' primary weapons are equipped when they spawn, eliminating compatability issues with tNoUnlocksPls.
	- Automatic database reconnection now works as intended. This should result in fewer stat glitches.
	- Improved string sanitation.
	
	Configuration:
	- Updated stat tracking to support newer weapons, and weapons from all 9 classes.

0.0.5 - April 9th, 2011
	Features:
	- mgemod_hide_rating: disables the in-game display of ELO rating. Players must visit a website running the MGEStats WebUI to view their stats.
		- "top5" and "rank" still function in-game, but do not show ELO ratings.
	- MGEMod can now automatically detect errors in the database connection and disable stats to prevent data loss. (Experimental)
		- "mgemod_reconnect_interval" controls how long (in minutes) MGEMod should wait before retrying the database connection after it has detected an error.
		- Upon a successful reconnect, stats will be re-enabled.
	- In-game command "hidehud" has been added at the request of the community.
		- Toggles the display of the text overlay elements on and off. Type "!hidehud" in chat to use.

	Configuration:
	- The default setting for "mgemod_dbconfig" is now "mgemod" instead of "default".
		- If you used a custom database configuration (tf/addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg) and had it named "default", then you should rename it to "mgemod".
		- If you have no idea what a custom database configuration is, then you should not need to worry about this (MGEMod will automatically use the local database).
	- Added new cvar "mgemod_stats" to enable/disable stats on the fly.
		- Setting "mgemod_dbconfig" to "" will no longer disable stats. Use this new cvar instead.

	Optimization:
	- Removed code that controlled custom (quake) sounds.

	WebUI:
	- Slight appearance tweaks.

	Fixes:
	- When a player spawns, they now will always spawn with their primary weapon equipped.
	- Fixed some error logging that would cause itself to error when called.
	- Fixed several cases where the plugin would attempt to communicate with a database when it shouldn't have been allowed to.
	- Fixed a bug where a specific player's Steam ID would somehow get a single quote appended to it, causing SQL queries to fail.

	TODO:
	- Figure out why T_SQLQueryOnConnect fails so frequently.
		- People that conenct then disconnect before it has a chance to run?

0.0.4 - December 13, 2010
	Balance:
	- When a player changes classes in a duel, their opponent will recieve full health, in addition to the point they already recieve.

	Commands:
	- !top5 now uses a menu display, and properly displays names.
	- !add now supports arguments. Enter the number or partial/full name of the arena to join to immediately join it and bypass the menu.
		- Example: !add 1 will add you to the first arena as shown on the menu, which for mge_training_v3 is Viaduct Middle.
		- Example: !add via and !add Viaduct Middle will take you directly to Viaduct Middle.
		- If multiple matches (argument too vague) or no matches are found, the menu will display.
	+ Added !first chat command to automatically place players in the quickest available arena.
		- Searches for arenas with one player.
		- If none are found, searches for arenas with no players.
		- If none are found, displays the menu.
	+ Added !mgehelp chat command to print a list of MGEMod commands to console.

	Configuration:
	- Changed config file structure. Spawns are in mgemod_spawns.cfg, and weapon declarations (for stat tracking) are in mgemod_stats.cfg.
		- Both of these files can be found in 'tf/addons/sourcemod/configs/'
	- The map names in mgemod_spawns.cfg are no longer case sensitive.
	- AutoCvar now also sets mp_tournament 0.
	- Changed how early leavers are handled. It is now defined per-arena in mgemod_spawns.cfg
		-If a player leaves an arena when their opponent has more points than them, AND their opponents score is higher than
		the number defined by "earlyleave", then the leaver loses points and their opponent gains points.
	- HUD Health text is now set per-arena in mgemod_spawns.cfg by "showhp", it is also color-coded:
		- > 66% = Green
		- >= 33% = Yellow
		- < 33% = Red
	- Infinite Ammo is now set per-arena in mgemod_spawns.cfg by "infammo".
	- Arenas with respawns can now have their respawn delays changed via "respawntime" in mgemod_spawns.cfg
	+ Added spawn distance protection:
		- If a spawn point is within x amount of units (set per-arena in mgemod_spawns.cfg by "mindist") of your opponent, you won't spawn there.
	+ Added cvars to adjust the particle effect that is attached to a player when they hold the intel:
		- mgemod_bball_particle_red
		- mgemod_bball_particle_blue
	
	Features:
	+ Added advanced stat tracking, based on code provided by Jonas Jacobi.
		- WebUI created by Skyride.
	+ Added accuracy display for the spectator HUD.

	Fixes:
	- Fixed error in BBall hoop generation logic that caused it to log an error only when everything was working fine.
	- Fixed an error that prevented the plugin from realizing a duel in a normal ammomod arena had reached its fraglimit.
	- Fixed a spectating in floor bug.
	- Fixed a case where a duel's stats could get reported multiple times.
	- Fixed a case where a disconnect could cause another player to spawn in "the black box".


0.0.3 - October 13, 2010
	- Tightened up client validity checks that caused logspam and odd behavior.
	- Prevented !add and !remove from being able to be used when not on an MGE or AM map.
	- Fixed an (often unintentional) exploit that allowed a client to leave an active match without losing points.
	- Changed translation format.
	- Started code cleanup and organization.
	- Fixed a bug where the score of a match would be printed to chat multiple times, and the ELO rating of the players would get calculated multiple times.
	+ Added BBall
	+ Added !top5 command. (Buggy)
	+ Added welcome message.
	+ Added automatic execution of team balance-related cvars, to prevent confusion on new installs. This can be toggled with mgemod_autocvar.
	+ Added optional debug logging, mostly centered around BBall. To use, uncomment "#define DEBUG_LOG" and re-compile.

0.0.2 - September 21, 2010
	- Changed Badlands Middle spawns to be less cluttered.
	- Fixed joinclass logic to prevent a "scout with a goddamn rocket launcher" exploit and to not award class change points during countdown.
	+ Added Russian translations, courtesy of Root_.

0.0.1 - September 20, 2010
	- Initial release.

TODO:
	Fix root_'s "double disconnect" bug.

Known Bugs:
	Changing class while taunting can cause a "civilian" glitch.
